# 3D Printable Yoyo Maker

## Overview

This application allows users to design and generate 3D printable yoyo models. Users can customize various parameters of the yoyo, such as its shape, size, and bearing seat, and then export the model as an STL file for 3D printing.

## Features

- **Customizable Yoyo Shape:** Adjust the profile of the yoyo to create unique designs.
- **Bearing Seat Configuration:** Configure the bearing seat to accommodate different bearing sizes.
- **Real-time 3D Preview:** See the changes to the yoyo model in real-time as you design it.
- **STL Export:** Download the designed yoyo model as an STL file, ready for 3D printing.

## How to Use

1.  **Launch the Application:** Start the application in your web browser.
2.  **Adjust Parameters:** Use the provided controls to modify the yoyo's shape, dimensions, and bearing seat.
3.  **Preview:** Observe the 3D model update in real-time.
4.  **Export:** Once satisfied with your design, click the "Export STL" button to download the 3D model.
